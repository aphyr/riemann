<h1>Ready? <span class="focus">Let's go!</span></h1>

<p class="callout">For this tutorial, you'll need a *nix system, Java,
and Ruby.</p>

<h2>Install Riemann</h2>

<code><pre>wget <a href="http://aphyr.com/riemann/riemann-0.1.0.tar.bz2">http://aphyr.com/riemann/riemann-0.1.0.tar.bz2</a>
tar xvfj riemann-0.1.0.tar.bz2
cd riemann-0.1.0</pre></code>

<p>Start the server</p>

<code><pre>bin/riemann etc/riemann.config</pre></code>

<p>Riemann is now listening for events. Install the Ruby client, tools,
and dashboard:</p>

<code><pre>gem install riemann-client riemann-tools riemann-dash</pre></code>

<p>Start the dashboard. If riemann-dash isn't in your path, check your
rubygems bin directory.</p>

<code><pre>riemann-dash</pre></code>

<p>Point your web browser to <a href="http://localhost:4567">http://localhost:4567/</a>. You should see a few empty boxes; that's because there are no events in the index yet. Let's send some:</p>

<code><pre>riemann-health</pre></code>

<p>The riemann-health daemon is a little Ruby program that submits events
about the state of your CPU, memory, load, and disks to a Riemann server.
If you switch back to the dashboard, you'll see your local host's state
appear under Health. The Problems list shows any states that aren't "ok",
so if you're running low on disk or ram they'll appear there. You can
hover over a state, like CPU, to see its description.</p>

<h2>The Ruby client</h2>

<p>Let's send some of our own states.</p>

<code><pre><span class="unfocus">$</span> irb -r riemann/client
<span class="unfocus">ruby-1.9.3 :001 &gt;</span> r = Riemann::Client.new
<span class="unfocus"> =&gt; #&lt;Riemann::Client ... &gt;</span></pre></code>

<p>We can send events with <code>&lt;&lt;</code>. For example, let's log an HTTP request.</p>

<code><pre><span class="unfocus">ruby-1.9.3 :002 &gt;</span> r &lt;&lt; { 
host: "www1", 
service: "http req", 
metric: 2.53, 
state: "critical", 
description: "Request took 2.53 seconds.", 
tags: ["http"]
}</pre></code>

<p>On the dashboard, critical events (like the one we just submitted)
show up in red. All of these fields are optional, by the way. The ruby
client will assume your events come from the local hostname unless you
pass <code>host: nil</code>.</p>

<p>Now let's ask for all events that have a service beginning with
"http".</p>

<code><pre><span class="unfocus">ruby-1.9.3 :003 &gt;</span> r['service =~ "http%"']
<span class="unfocus">[&lt;Riemann::Event time: 1330041937, state: "critical", service: "http req", host: "www1", 
description: "Request took 2.53 seconds.", tags: ["http"], ttl: 300.0, metric_f: 2.5299999713897705&gt;]</span></pre></code>

<p>There's the event we submitted. You could send these events from Rack
middleware to log every request to your app, or track exceptions. Riemann
can be configured to calculate rates, averages, min/max, distributions,
and more. To get started, read the <a
  href="configuring.html">configuration guide</a>.</p>
