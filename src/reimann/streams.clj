  "Streams are functions which accept events (or, in some cases, lists of
  events). They can filter those events, transform them, apply them to other
  streams, combine them over time, update state, forward to other services, and
  more. Most streams accept, after their initial arguments, any number of
  streams as children. When invoking children, they typically catch all
  exceptions and log them, then proceed to the next child.
  
  Any function accepting an event map (e.g. {:service \"foo\" :metric 3.5} can
  be a stream. prn is a stream. So is (partial log :info), or (fn [x]). The
  streams namespace aims to provide a comprehensive set of widely applicable,
  combinable tools for building up more complicated streams."
